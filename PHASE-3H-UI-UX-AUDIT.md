  interactive: {
    primary: visualConfig.colors.primary,
    primaryHover: adjustLuminance(visualConfig.colors.primary, -10),
    primaryActive: adjustLuminance(visualConfig.colors.primary, -20),
    primaryDisabled: opacity(visualConfig.colors.primary, 0.4),
  },
  feedback: {
    success: '#22C55E',
    warning: '#EAB308',
    error: '#EF4444',
    info: visualConfig.colors.primary,
  },
  surfaces: {
    base: visualConfig.colors.background,
    raised: visualConfig.colors.surface,
    elevated: visualConfig.colors.elevated,
    overlay: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)',
  }
};
```

### Animation Standards
```typescript
// Standardize timing functions
const animations = {
  durations: {
    instant: '100ms',
    fast: '200ms',
    normal: '300ms',
    slow: '500ms',
  },
  easings: {
    default: 'cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)',
    in: 'cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 1, 1)',
    out: 'cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.2, 1)',
    inOut: 'cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)',
  }
};
```

### Spacing Scale
```typescript
// Standardize spacing
const spacing = {
  xs: '0.25rem',  // 4px
  sm: '0.5rem',   // 8px
  md: '1rem',     // 16px
  lg: '1.5rem',   // 24px
  xl: '2rem',     // 32px
  '2xl': '3rem',  // 48px

## Conclusion

The customer management system has a solid foundation with good mobile gesture support and theming integration. However, critical accessibility gaps and missing UX patterns prevent it from being production-ready for enterprise deployment.

**Recommended Action:** Proceed with enhanced component implementations focusing on P0 accessibility fixes and P1 mobile/visual enhancements.

**Next Steps:**
1. Review enhanced component code (provided separately)
2. Conduct accessibility audit with screen reader testing
3. Perform mobile device testing on iOS and Android
4. Gather user feedback through usability testing sessions

```

### Option 3: Using Supabase CLI

## Verification

After running the migration, verify the data was created:

### Check Jobs
```sql
SELECT
  job_number,
  title,
  status,
  estimated_total,
  priority
FROM ops_jobs
ORDER BY job_number;
```

**Expected Result:** 4 jobs (JOB-2025-001 through JOB-2025-004)

### Check Jobs with Customers
```sql
SELECT
  j.job_number,
  c.customer_name,
  j.status,
  j.estimated_total
FROM ops_jobs j
JOIN crm_customers c ON j.customer_id = c.id
ORDER BY j.job_number;
```

**Expected Result:** Jobs linked to Sarah Johnson (2), Michael Chen (1), Emily Rodriguez (1)

### Check Services Per Job
```sql
SELECT
  j.job_number,
  j.title,
  COUNT(s.id) as service_count,
  SUM(s.total_price) as services_total
FROM ops_jobs j
LEFT JOIN ops_job_services s ON j.id = s.job_id
GROUP BY j.job_number, j.title
ORDER BY j.job_number;
```

**Expected Result:** Each job should have 2 services

### Check Notes Per Job
```sql
SELECT
  j.job_number,
  j.title,
  COUNT(n.id) as note_count
FROM ops_jobs j
LEFT JOIN ops_job_notes n ON j.id = n.job_id
GROUP BY j.job_number, j.title
ORDER BY j.job_number;
```

**Expected Result:**
- JOB-2025-001: 1 note
- JOB-2025-002: 2 notes
- JOB-2025-003: 2 notes
- JOB-2025-004: 3 notes

## What You'll See in the Jobs UI

### Kanban View
- **Quote Column:** 1 job (Sarah's backyard patio)
- **Scheduled Column:** 1 job (Sarah's front walkway)
- **In Progress Column:** 1 job (Michael's commercial patio)
- **Completed Column:** 1 job (Emily's driveway)

### List/Table View
- All 4 jobs sortable by any column
- Different priority indicators (normal, high, urgent)
- Status badges with appropriate colors

### Calendar View
- Jobs with scheduled dates will appear (when calendar is fully implemented)
- Currently just shows job counts and totals

## Important Notes

### Crews Not Assigned
Since the Crews feature isn't fully implemented yet, these jobs do NOT have crew assignments. You'll see:
- No crew avatars on job cards
- No entries in `ops_job_assignments` table
- Calendar view won't show crew rows yet

**This is expected!** Once you implement the Crews feature, you can:
1. Create crew records in `ops_crews` table
2. Assign jobs to crews via the UI
3. Create entries in `ops_job_assignments` table

### Realistic Data
All data is based on realistic landscaping/hardscaping scenarios:
- Accurate service pricing (based on your existing pricing configs)
- Real-world project descriptions
- Typical timeline progressions
- Common customer communication notes

### Test Scenarios Covered
âœ… Quote stage (awaiting customer approval)
âœ… Scheduled job (approved, dates set)
âœ… Active job (work in progress)
âœ… Completed job (finished, customer happy)
âœ… Multiple jobs for same customer
âœ… Different priority levels
âœ… Various price ranges ($12k - $90k)
âœ… Residential and commercial projects

## Rollback (If Needed)

If you need to remove the test data:

```sql
-- Delete in reverse order (foreign key constraints)
DELETE FROM ops_job_notes
WHERE job_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM ops_jobs
  WHERE job_number LIKE 'JOB-2025-00%'
);

DELETE FROM ops_job_services
WHERE job_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM ops_jobs
  WHERE job_number LIKE 'JOB-2025-00%'
);

DELETE FROM ops_jobs
WHERE job_number LIKE 'JOB-2025-00%';
```

## Next Steps

After running this migration:

1. **Test the Jobs UI:**
   - Open the Jobs page
   - Switch between Kanban, List, and Calendar views
   - Try dragging jobs between Kanban columns
   - Search for customers and job numbers
   - Sort the table by different columns

2. **Create More Jobs:**
   - Use the "+ Create Job" button (when wizard is implemented)
   - Or duplicate this migration pattern for more test data

3. **Add Crews:**
   - When Crews feature is ready, create crew records
   - Assign these jobs to crews
   - Test the Calendar view with assignments

4. **Test Job Detail Modal:**
   - Click on job cards to view details (when implemented)
   - Add more notes
   - Edit services
   - View activity timeline

## Support

If you encounter any errors:
1. Check that you're connected to the correct database
2. Verify your company_id matches (08f0827a-608f-485a-a19f-e0c55ecf6484)
3. Ensure customer records exist (3 customers)
4. Check that service configs exist (paver_patio_sqft, excavation_removal)
5. Verify RLS policies allow these operations

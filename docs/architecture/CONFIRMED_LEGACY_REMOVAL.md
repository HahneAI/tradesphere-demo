## Navigation Components - Confirmed Removals

### 1. MobileHamburgerMenu.tsx ‚úÖ REMOVED (Commit: 51dce85)

**File Location**: `src/components/mobile/MobileHamburgerMenu.tsx` ‚ùå DELETED

**Why It's Legacy**:
- Only imported in `ChatInterface.tsx` (1 reference)
- NOT imported in `App.tsx` (primary navigation manager)
- Completely replaced by modern `BottomNav.tsx` for mobile
- Desktop uses `HeaderMenu.tsx` instead
- 327 lines of code providing duplicate navigation

**What It Did**:
- Old mobile navigation menu (hamburger icon)
- Provided access to: Services, Materials, Customers, Billing, Quick Calculator
- Used slide-out drawer pattern

**Modern Replacement**:
- **Mobile**: `BottomNav.tsx` (tab bar navigation)
- **Desktop**: `HeaderMenu.tsx` (dropdown menu)
- Both managed by `DashboardHome.tsx` ‚Üí `App.tsx` state

**Dependencies to Remove**:
```tsx
// In ChatInterface.tsx - REMOVE THESE:
import { MobileHamburgerMenu } from './mobile/MobileHamburgerMenu';
const [showHamburgerMenu, setShowHamburgerMenu] = useState(false);

// REMOVE JSX:
<MobileHamburgerMenu
  isOpen={showHamburgerMenu}
  onClose={() => setShowHamburgerMenu(false)}
  // ... props
/>

// REMOVE button that opens it (search for setShowHamburgerMenu(true))
```

**Removal Steps**:
1. Remove import from `ChatInterface.tsx`
2. Remove state: `const [showHamburgerMenu, setShowHamburgerMenu] = useState(false);`
3. Remove JSX render of `<MobileHamburgerMenu />`
4. Remove button/trigger that calls `setShowHamburgerMenu(true)`
5. Delete file: `rm src/components/mobile/MobileHamburgerMenu.tsx`
6. Delete empty folder: `rmdir src/components/mobile/` (if no other files)

**Testing After Removal**:
- [ ] Dashboard loads correctly
- [ ] Mobile navigation works via BottomNav
- [ ] Desktop navigation works via HeaderMenu
- [ ] No console errors about missing MobileHamburgerMenu
- [ ] All modals still accessible (Services, Materials, etc.)

**Risk**: üü¢ LOW (10/100) - Only 1 import, no unique features

---

### 2. Mobile Folder (if empty) ‚úÖ REMOVED (Commit: 51dce85)

**File Location**: `src/components/mobile/` ‚ùå DELETED

**Removal Steps**:
```bash
# After removing MobileHamburgerMenu, check if folder is empty
ls src/components/mobile/

# If empty, remove folder
rmdir src/components/mobile/
```

**Risk**: üü¢ NONE - Only remove if empty

---

## Services Components - Confirmed Removals

### 3. ServicesTab.tsx ‚úÖ REMOVED (Commit: c76765c)

**File Location**: `src/components/ServicesTab.tsx` ‚ùå DELETED

**Why It's Likely Legacy**:
- NOT imported in `App.tsx` (which uses `ServicesPage.tsx` instead)
- Only wraps `ServicesDatabaseView` in a modal container
- Duplicate of `ServicesPage` functionality
- 70 lines of simple modal wrapper code

**What It Did**:
- Modal wrapper for service management
- Rendered `ServicesDatabaseView` inside modal card
- Simple pass-through component with header and close button

**Modern Replacement**:
- `ServicesPage.tsx` - Full-page modal with complete service management
- Active component rendered by App.tsx (lines 255-258)
- Has table view, card view, search, admin editing, etc.

**BEFORE REMOVAL - VERIFICATION REQUIRED**:
```bash
# Search entire codebase for ServicesTab usage
grep -r "ServicesTab" src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"

# Expected result: 1 match (the file itself)
# If more matches found ‚Üí INVESTIGATE before removing
```

**Removal Steps** (ONLY if verification passes):
1. Verify search shows only 1 result (ServicesTab.tsx itself)
2. Delete file: `rm src/components/ServicesTab.tsx`
3. Run `npm run build` to verify no TypeScript errors
4. Test ServicesPage still works from dashboard

**Testing After Removal**:
- [ ] Build succeeds with no TypeScript errors
- [ ] ServicesPage opens from dashboard Services button
- [ ] No console errors about missing ServicesTab
- [ ] Services configuration works correctly

**Risk**: üü° MEDIUM (40/100) - Need to verify no hidden references first

---

### 4. ServicesDatabaseView.tsx ‚úÖ REMOVED (Commit: 3aeced5)

**File Location**: `src/components/services/ServicesDatabaseView.tsx` ‚ùå DELETED

**Why It's Likely Legacy**:
- Only used by `ServicesTab.tsx` (which is itself legacy)
- NOT used by `ServicesPage.tsx` (active component)
- 220 lines with admin controls and service cards
- Functionality replicated in ServicesPage

**What It Did**:
- Inner component for service database view
- Admin vs non-admin UI logic
- ServiceRecordCard rendering
- Custom service wizard integration (NEW - added in recent work)

**Modern Replacement**:
- `ServicesPage.tsx` has its own implementation
- Uses ServiceCard component instead
- Direct integration with useServiceBaseSettings hook

**CRITICAL NOTE**:
Recent work added Custom Service Wizard integration to ServicesDatabaseView.tsx.
However, the wizard was ALSO added to ServicesPage.tsx (commit 246a444).
Since ServicesPage is the active component, ServicesDatabaseView's wizard integration is unused.

**BEFORE REMOVAL - VERIFICATION REQUIRED**:
```bash
# Check if ServicesDatabaseView is imported anywhere besides ServicesTab
grep -r "ServicesDatabaseView" src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"

# Expected result: 1 match (ServicesTab.tsx import)
# If more matches ‚Üí INVESTIGATE
```

**Removal Steps** (ONLY if ServicesTab removed first):
1. Verify ServicesTab is already removed
2. Verify search shows only 1 result or zero results
3. Delete file: `rm src/components/services/ServicesDatabaseView.tsx`
4. Run `npm run build` to verify no errors
5. Test ServicesPage functionality

**Testing After Removal**:
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] ServicesPage works correctly
- [ ] Custom Service Wizard opens from ServicesPage
- [ ] No references to ServicesDatabaseView in console errors

**Risk**: üü° MEDIUM (50/100) - Recently modified, has business logic

---

## Backup Files - Confirmed Removals

### 5. CustomersTab.enhanced.tsx ‚úÖ REMOVED (Commit: 0b5d5d7)

**Why It's Legacy**:
- Backup file from previous refactoring
- NOT imported anywhere in codebase
- Main `CustomersTab.tsx` is the active component

**Removal Steps**:
```bash
rm src/components/CustomersTab.enhanced.tsx
```

**Risk**: üü¢ NONE - Backup file only

---

### 6. CustomersTab.backup.tsx ‚úÖ REMOVED (Commit: 0b5d5d7)

**File Location**: `src/components/CustomersTab.backup.tsx` ‚ùå DELETED

**Why It's Legacy**:
- Backup file from previous refactoring
- NOT imported anywhere in codebase
- Main `CustomersTab.tsx` is the active component

**Removal Steps**:
```bash
rm src/components/CustomersTab.backup.tsx
```

**Risk**: üü¢ NONE - Backup file only

```bash
# Search entire codebase
grep -r "ServicesTab" src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"

# Expected: 1 match (ServicesTab.tsx file itself)
# If more matches: STOP and investigate those files first
```

**Step 2 - Remove ServicesTab** (10 minutes) - ONLY if verification passed:

No functional changes - ServicesPage already in use"
```

**Step 3 - Verify ServicesDatabaseView is Unused** (5 minutes):
```bash
# Search entire codebase
grep -r "ServicesDatabaseView" src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"

# Expected: 0 matches (or 1 match if ServicesTab still exists)
# If ServicesTab removed: should be 0 matches
# If any other matches: STOP and investigate
```

**Step 4 - Remove ServicesDatabaseView** (10 minutes) - ONLY if verification passed:

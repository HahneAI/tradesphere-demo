# Legacy Code - Investigation Required Before Removal

**Status**: Research & Analysis Phase
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Requires Deep Dive Before Changes
**Risk Level**: HIGH - May Break Active Features

---

## Executive Summary

This document lists legacy code, systems, and patterns that appear outdated but **require investigation before removal**. These components fail one or more safety criteria:

‚ö†Ô∏è **Multiple references** across codebase
‚ö†Ô∏è **Unclear if still used** in production workflows
‚ö†Ô∏è **May contain unique logic** not replicated elsewhere
‚ö†Ô∏è **Recently modified** (suggesting active use)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Complex integration** with other systems

**Total Systems Requiring Investigation**: 5 major areas
**Estimated Investigation Time**: 1-2 days
**Estimated Refactoring Time** (if removal chosen): 2-5 days per system

---

## Investigation Framework

### Classification System

Each legacy system is classified by:

**üî¥ CRITICAL** - Removal would break production features
**üü° IMPORTANT** - Removal requires significant refactoring
**üü¢ OPTIONAL** - Removal is nice-to-have, low priority

### Investigation Checklist Template

For each system, complete:

- [ ] **Usage Analysis**: Grep entire codebase for references
- [ ] **User Workflow Analysis**: Trace through user interactions
- [ ] **Database Dependencies**: Check for specific tables/queries
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Check for feature flags or config
- [ ] **Git History**: Review when last modified and why
- [ ] **Documentation Review**: Search for mentions in docs/comments
- [ ] **Stakeholder Interview**: Ask product owner if still needed
- [ ] **Testing Coverage**: Check if tests exist for this feature

## System 1: Dual Testing Mode (Pricing Engine) üî¥ CRITICAL

### Description

TradeSphere originally supported **two pricing calculation methods**:

1. **Native Pricing** - JavaScript-based calculation in frontend/backend
2. **Make.com Webhook Pricing** - External API call to Make.com automation

A "Dual Testing Mode" was implemented to switch between these methods for comparison and testing.

### Why It Might Be Legacy

- Make.com webhook approach may have been deprecated
- Native pricing is more reliable and faster
- Webhook adds external dependency and latency
- Testing mode suggests experimental feature, not production-ready

### Why It Might Still Be Needed

- Some companies may still use Make.com integrations
- Webhook pricing may handle complex edge cases
- A/B testing for pricing accuracy
- Fallback mechanism if native pricing fails

### Investigation Required

**1. Code Search**:
```bash
# Search for dual testing mode references
grep -ri "dual.?test" src/ docs/
grep -ri "make\.com" src/ docs/
grep -ri "webhook.*pric" src/ docs/
grep -ri "pricing.*mode" src/ docs/
grep -ri "native.*pricing" src/ docs/

# Check environment variables
grep -r "PRICING_MODE" .env* src/
grep -r "WEBHOOK_URL" .env* src/
grep -r "MAKE_COM" .env* src/
```

**2. Database Schema Check**:
```sql
-- Check for pricing mode configuration in database
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name IN ('companies', 'service_configurations', 'pricing_configs')
  AND column_name LIKE '%pricing%mode%';

-- Check for webhook URLs stored
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name IN ('companies', 'integrations')
  AND column_name LIKE '%webhook%';
```

**3. File Locations to Investigate**:
```
src/services/masterPricingEngine.ts  # Check for mode switching logic
src/services/pricingWebhookService.ts  # Webhook integration (if exists)
src/config/pricing.ts  # Pricing configuration
src/context/PricingContext.tsx  # Pricing state management
docs/pricing/  # Any pricing documentation
```

**4. User Settings Check**:
- [ ] Admin panel: Is there a "Pricing Mode" toggle?
- [ ] Company settings: Can companies choose pricing method?
- [ ] Environment config: Is pricing mode set per deployment?

**5. Git History**:
```bash
# Check when dual testing mode was last modified
git log --all --grep="dual.*test" --oneline
git log --all --grep="make.com" --oneline
git log --all --grep="webhook.*pric" --oneline

# Check recent changes to pricing engine
git log --since="6 months ago" -- src/services/masterPricingEngine.ts
```

### Decision Criteria

**REMOVE IF**:
- ‚úÖ No companies currently using Make.com webhook pricing
- ‚úÖ Native pricing handles all use cases
- ‚úÖ No environment variables set for webhook mode
- ‚úÖ No UI toggle for pricing mode
- ‚úÖ Last modified > 6 months ago with no activity

**KEEP IF**:
- ‚ùå Any production company uses webhook pricing
- ‚ùå Webhook handles edge cases native doesn't
- ‚ùå Feature flag exists and is actively toggled
- ‚ùå Recent modifications or bug fixes

**MIGRATE IF**:
- üîÑ Only 1-2 companies use webhook pricing ‚Üí migrate them to native
- üîÑ Webhook is fallback mechanism ‚Üí replace with better error handling
- üîÑ Used for A/B testing ‚Üí complete testing and choose winner

### Removal/Migration Plan

**IF DECISION: Remove Dual Testing Mode**

1. **Create feature flag** (if doesn't exist):
   ```tsx
   const ENABLE_WEBHOOK_PRICING = false; // Default off
   ```

2. **Notify affected users**:
   - Email companies using webhook pricing
   - Provide 30-day migration window
   - Offer native pricing training

3. **Migration steps**:
   - Test all services with native pricing
   - Compare webhook vs native results
   - Document any discrepancies
   - Fix native pricing to match webhook results

4. **Gradual rollout**:
   ```tsx
   // Week 1: Feature flag off for new companies
   // Week 2: Feature flag off for 50% of existing companies
   // Week 3: Feature flag off for 90% of companies
   // Week 4: Remove code entirely
   ```

5. **Code removal**:
   - Remove webhook pricing service
   - Remove Make.com integration code
   - Remove dual mode toggle UI
   - Remove environment variables
   - Update documentation
   - Simplify masterPricingEngine.ts

## System 2: ChatInterface Legacy Navigation üü° IMPORTANT

### Description

`ChatInterface.tsx` is the AI-powered pricing chat interface. It appears to have legacy navigation patterns from pre-CRM architecture:

- Imports `MobileHamburgerMenu` (confirmed legacy - see CONFIRMED_LEGACY_REMOVAL.md)
- May have duplicate tab imports (`CustomersTab`, `ServicesTab`)
- Unclear if it's still a primary screen or just a tab

### Why It Might Be Legacy

- DashboardHome is now the primary screen
- Modern navigation via HeaderMenu and BottomNav
- ChatInterface may have been the old "home screen"
- Duplicate modal triggering logic

### Why It Might Still Be Needed

- AI chat is core feature for quote generation
- Users may access chat directly (not via dashboard)
- Chat may have unique navigation needs
- Pricing calculator workflow depends on it

### Investigation Required

**1. Usage Analysis**:
```bash
# Check how ChatInterface is used
grep -r "ChatInterface" src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"

# Check if users can access chat directly
grep -r "activeTab.*chat" src/App.tsx
grep -r "setActiveTab.*chat" src/

# Check navigation to chat
grep -r "onChatClick" src/
grep -r "showChat" src/
```

**2. App.tsx Analysis**:
```tsx
// In src/App.tsx, check:
// - Is ChatInterface rendered as a tab? (lines 221-230)
// - Can users still access it?
// - Is it primary screen or secondary?

// Look for:
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState<'dashboard' | 'chat'>('dashboard');

<ChatInterface
  isOpen={activeTab === 'chat'}
  // ... props
/>
```

**3. Navigation Flow**:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Login] --> B{Which Screen?}
    B -->|Default| C[DashboardHome]
    B -->|Chat Tab| D[ChatInterface]

    C --> E[Can Click Chat Tab]
    E --> D

    D --> F[Has Legacy Navigation?]
    F -->|YES| G[MobileHamburgerMenu - LEGACY]
    F -->|NO| H[Uses Modern Navigation]

    style G fill:#ff9999
    style H fill:#90EE90
```

**4. User Workflows**:
- [ ] Can users create quotes via chat?
- [ ] Is chat accessible from dashboard?
- [ ] Is chat still a tab in BottomNav?
- [ ] Does chat have its own navigation menu?

**5. Feature Dependencies**:
- [ ] AI chat engine (Claude/GPT API)
- [ ] Conversation memory system
- [ ] Quote generation workflow
- [ ] Customer context integration

### Decision Criteria

**OPTION A: Keep ChatInterface as Tab, Remove Legacy Navigation**
- Chat is still active feature
- Users need AI-powered quoting
- Remove MobileHamburgerMenu from ChatInterface
- Use shared HeaderMenu and BottomNav
- Keep chat accessible via tab

**OPTION B: Move Chat to Dashboard Panel**
- Embed chat as panel in DashboardHome
- Remove ChatInterface as separate screen
- Create new `ChatPanel.tsx` component
- Integrate into dashboard layout
- Deprecate standalone ChatInterface

**OPTION C: Remove Chat Entirely** (UNLIKELY)
- Only if AI chat is no longer needed
- Would require major product decision
- Probably NOT viable (chat is core feature)

### Recommended Action

**OPTION A** (Most Likely):

1. **Keep ChatInterface.tsx** - Still needed for AI chat
2. **Remove MobileHamburgerMenu** from ChatInterface (already in CONFIRMED_LEGACY_REMOVAL.md)
3. **Remove duplicate imports**:
   ```tsx
   // In ChatInterface.tsx, REMOVE:
   import { ServicesTab } from './ServicesTab';  // Use App.tsx state instead
   import { CustomersTab } from './CustomersTab';  // Use App.tsx state instead
   ```
4. **Use shared navigation**:
   - Keep HeaderMenu (already used)
   - Add BottomNav if on mobile
   - Remove custom navigation logic
5. **Trigger modals via callbacks to App.tsx**:
   ```tsx
   // Instead of ChatInterface opening ServicesTab directly:
   // Pass callback from App.tsx:
   <ChatInterface
     onServicesClick={() => setShowServicesPage(true)}
     onCustomersClick={() => setShowCustomersTab(true)}
   />
   ```

## System 3: ServiceConfigManager Legacy Methods üü° IMPORTANT

### Description

`ServiceConfigManager` service handles CRUD operations for service configurations. May contain legacy methods from old pricing calculator days.

### Why It Might Be Legacy

- Some methods may pre-date current database schema
- May have duplicate logic with newer services
- Could have hardcoded values from MVP phase
- May use deprecated Supabase query patterns

### Investigation Required

**1. Code Review**:
```bash
# Read the entire service
cat src/services/ServiceConfigManager.ts

# Look for:
# - Deprecated methods (unused elsewhere)
# - TODO comments about cleanup
# - Hardcoded values
# - Old table names or schema
```

**2. Method Usage Analysis**:
```bash
# For each method in ServiceConfigManager, check usage:
grep -r "serviceConfigManager\.createService" src/
grep -r "serviceConfigManager\.updateService" src/
grep -r "serviceConfigManager\.deleteService" src/
grep -r "serviceConfigManager\.getService" src/

# Check for methods with 0 references ‚Üí candidates for removal
```

**3. Database Schema Alignment**:
```sql
-- Check current service_configurations table schema
SELECT column_name, data_type, column_default
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'service_configurations'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- Compare with what ServiceConfigManager expects
-- Check for:
-- - Columns that ServiceConfigManager references but don't exist
-- - Columns in DB that ServiceConfigManager doesn't use
```

**4. Recent Usage**:
```bash
# Check when ServiceConfigManager was last used
git log --since="3 months ago" -- src/services/ServiceConfigManager.ts

# Check imports of ServiceConfigManager
grep -r "import.*ServiceConfigManager" src/
```

### Decision Criteria

**REMOVE METHOD IF**:
- ‚úÖ 0 references in codebase (unused)
- ‚úÖ Functionality replaced by hook (useServiceBaseSettings)
- ‚úÖ Accesses deprecated database columns
- ‚úÖ Hardcoded to old pricing formula

**KEEP METHOD IF**:
- ‚ùå Active references in components
- ‚ùå Used by Custom Service Wizard
- ‚ùå Unique functionality not available elsewhere
- ‚ùå Part of public API for future features

**REFACTOR IF**:
- üîÑ Uses deprecated Supabase patterns ‚Üí update to modern
- üîÑ Has hardcoded values ‚Üí move to config
- üîÑ Duplicate logic with hooks ‚Üí consolidate
- üîÑ Missing error handling ‚Üí add proper errors

## System 4: Material Calculation Methods (Legacy Units) üü¢ OPTIONAL

### Description

Materials management may have legacy calculation methods from old pricing formulas. Check for:

- Deprecated unit types (old vs new measurement systems)
- Hardcoded coverage rates (should be database-driven)
- Legacy waste factor calculations
- Old compaction formulas

### Investigation Required

**1. Materials Database Schema**:
```sql
-- Check materials table columns
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name LIKE '%material%';

-- Check for legacy unit types
SELECT DISTINCT unit_type FROM materials;
SELECT DISTINCT calculation_method FROM materials;
```

**2. Code Search**:
```bash
# Search for hardcoded material calculations
grep -r "coverage.*rate" src/
grep -r "waste.*factor" src/
grep -r "compaction.*factor" src/
grep -r "SQFT\|sqft\|sq_ft" src/services/

# Check for magic numbers in pricing calculations
grep -r "1\.1\|1\.15\|1\.2\|1\.25\|0\.8\|0\.85" src/services/
```

**3. Materials Configuration**:
```bash
# Check materials config files
cat src/config/materials.ts  # If exists
cat src/config/coverage-rates.ts  # If exists

# Look for hardcoded material data
grep -r "const.*materials.*=" src/config/
```

### Decision Criteria

**MIGRATE IF**:
- üîÑ Hardcoded coverage rates ‚Üí move to database
- üîÑ Legacy unit conversions ‚Üí standardize on single system
- üîÑ Magic numbers in calculations ‚Üí move to config

**Priority**: LOW (this is optimization, not critical bug)

## System 5: Onboarding Flow Legacy Screens üü° IMPORTANT

### Description

Onboarding may have legacy screens from different product iterations:

- Old company setup wizard
- Deprecated service selection screens
- Legacy payment flow (if pricing model changed)
- Old user role assignment screens

### Investigation Required

**1. Onboarding Components**:
```bash
# List all onboarding files
ls -la src/components/onboarding/

# Check which are actually rendered
grep -r "OnboardingLanding" src/App.tsx
grep -r "OnboardingWizard" src/App.tsx

# Look for duplicate or versioned components
ls src/components/onboarding/*v2* 2>/dev/null
ls src/components/onboarding/*old* 2>/dev/null
ls src/components/onboarding/*legacy* 2>/dev/null
```

**2. Onboarding Flow**:
```tsx
// In App.tsx, check onboarding logic
// Look for conditions that determine which onboarding screen shows

// Check for:
// - Multiple onboarding paths
// - Feature flags for onboarding versions
// - A/B testing logic
```

**3. Database Checks**:
```sql
-- Check user onboarding status
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'users'
  AND column_name LIKE '%onboard%';

-- Check if old onboarding flags exist
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'companies'
  AND column_name LIKE '%setup%' OR column_name LIKE '%wizard%';
```

### Decision Criteria

**KEEP CURRENT ONBOARDING** - Likely active
**REMOVE OLD VERSIONS** - If versioned files found
**CONSOLIDATE** - If multiple similar flows exist

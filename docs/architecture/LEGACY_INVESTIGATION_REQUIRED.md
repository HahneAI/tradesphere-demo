# Legacy Code - Investigation Required Before Removal

**Status**: Research & Analysis Phase
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Requires Deep Dive Before Changes
**Risk Level**: HIGH - May Break Active Features

---

## Executive Summary

This document lists legacy code, systems, and patterns that appear outdated but **require investigation before removal**. These components fail one or more safety criteria:

‚ö†Ô∏è **Multiple references** across codebase
‚ö†Ô∏è **Unclear if still used** in production workflows
‚ö†Ô∏è **May contain unique logic** not replicated elsewhere
‚ö†Ô∏è **Recently modified** (suggesting active use)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Complex integration** with other systems

**Total Systems Requiring Investigation**: 4 major areas (1 completed)
**Estimated Investigation Time**: 1-2 days
**Estimated Refactoring Time** (if removal chosen): 2-5 days per system

**Recently Completed**: System 1 - Dual Testing Mode (‚úÖ October 25, 2025 - See CONFIRMED_LEGACY_REMOVAL.md)

---

## Investigation Framework

### Classification System

Each legacy system is classified by:

**üî¥ CRITICAL** - Removal would break production features
**üü° IMPORTANT** - Removal requires significant refactoring
**üü¢ OPTIONAL** - Removal is nice-to-have, low priority

### Investigation Checklist Template

For each system, complete:

- [ ] **Usage Analysis**: Grep entire codebase for references
- [ ] **User Workflow Analysis**: Trace through user interactions
- [ ] **Database Dependencies**: Check for specific tables/queries
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Check for feature flags or config
- [ ] **Git History**: Review when last modified and why
- [ ] **Documentation Review**: Search for mentions in docs/comments
- [ ] **Stakeholder Interview**: Ask product owner if still needed
- [ ] **Testing Coverage**: Check if tests exist for this feature

## ~~System 2: ChatInterface Legacy Navigation~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Status**: ‚úÖ INVESTIGATION COMPLETE - CLEAN ARCHITECTURE CONFIRMED
**Completed**: October 25, 2025
**Decision**: KEEP (with minor cleanup) - Modern callback architecture in place

### Investigation Summary

`ChatInterface.tsx` was investigated for legacy navigation patterns from pre-CRM architecture. Investigation revealed the component is already using modern patterns.

### Key Findings

‚úÖ **Modern Architecture Confirmed:**
- Uses callback pattern (onNavigate, onServicesClick, onMaterialsClick, etc.)
- All navigation handled via App.tsx state management (lines 222-229)
- HeaderMenu properly integrated for navigation
- No MobileHamburgerMenu references (already removed in previous cleanup)
- No duplicate tab imports or modal triggering logic
- Callbacks already implemented: onBackToDashboard, onNavigate, onServicesClick, onMaterialsClick, onQuickCalculatorClick, onCompanySettingsClick

‚úÖ **Only Issue Found:**
- One unused import: `import { CustomersTab } from './CustomersTab'` (line 29)
- Import was never used to render the component
- Only referenced in a comment describing handleLoadCustomer function

### Cleanup Executed

**Changes Made:**
- Removed unused CustomersTab import (1 line)
- Updated comment from "from CustomersTab" to "from customer context service"
- **Commit**: 6fd718f - refactor: remove unused CustomersTab import from ChatInterface

**Build Verification:**
- ‚úÖ Build succeeds with no TypeScript errors
- ‚úÖ No functionality changes
- ‚úÖ Risk: NONE (import was unused)

### Architecture Validation

**Current Implementation (APPROVED):**
```tsx
// App.tsx properly manages all navigation:
<ChatInterface
  onBackToDashboard={() => setActiveTab('dashboard')}
  onNavigate={(tab) => setActiveTab(tab as ActiveTab)}
  onServicesClick={() => setShowServicesPage(true)}
  onMaterialsClick={() => setShowMaterialsPage(true)}
  onQuickCalculatorClick={() => setShowQuickCalculator(true)}
  onCompanySettingsClick={() => setShowCompanySettings(true)}
/>
```

This is exactly the pattern we want - **no changes needed**.

### Conclusion

ChatInterface is a **well-architected component** using modern React patterns:
- ‚úÖ Callback-based navigation (not direct imports)
- ‚úÖ HeaderMenu for global navigation
- ‚úÖ No legacy navigation code
- ‚úÖ Clean separation of concerns

**No further cleanup required** for this system.

**Full Details**: See commit 6fd718f and [CONFIRMED_LEGACY_REMOVAL.md](./CONFIRMED_LEGACY_REMOVAL.md)

## System 3: ServiceConfigManager Legacy Methods üü° IMPORTANT

### Description

`ServiceConfigManager` service handles CRUD operations for service configurations. May contain legacy methods from old pricing calculator days.

### Why It Might Be Legacy

- Some methods may pre-date current database schema
- May have duplicate logic with newer services
- Could have hardcoded values from MVP phase
- May use deprecated Supabase query patterns

### Investigation Required

**1. Code Review**:
```bash
# Read the entire service
cat src/services/ServiceConfigManager.ts

# Look for:
# - Deprecated methods (unused elsewhere)
# - TODO comments about cleanup
# - Hardcoded values
# - Old table names or schema
```

**2. Method Usage Analysis**:
```bash
# For each method in ServiceConfigManager, check usage:
grep -r "serviceConfigManager\.createService" src/
grep -r "serviceConfigManager\.updateService" src/
grep -r "serviceConfigManager\.deleteService" src/
grep -r "serviceConfigManager\.getService" src/

# Check for methods with 0 references ‚Üí candidates for removal
```

**3. Database Schema Alignment**:
```sql
-- Check current service_configurations table schema
SELECT column_name, data_type, column_default
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'service_configurations'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- Compare with what ServiceConfigManager expects
-- Check for:
-- - Columns that ServiceConfigManager references but don't exist
-- - Columns in DB that ServiceConfigManager doesn't use
```

**4. Recent Usage**:
```bash
# Check when ServiceConfigManager was last used
git log --since="3 months ago" -- src/services/ServiceConfigManager.ts

# Check imports of ServiceConfigManager
grep -r "import.*ServiceConfigManager" src/
```

### Decision Criteria

**REMOVE METHOD IF**:
- ‚úÖ 0 references in codebase (unused)
- ‚úÖ Functionality replaced by hook (useServiceBaseSettings)
- ‚úÖ Accesses deprecated database columns
- ‚úÖ Hardcoded to old pricing formula

**KEEP METHOD IF**:
- ‚ùå Active references in components
- ‚ùå Used by Custom Service Wizard
- ‚ùå Unique functionality not available elsewhere
- ‚ùå Part of public API for future features

**REFACTOR IF**:
- üîÑ Uses deprecated Supabase patterns ‚Üí update to modern
- üîÑ Has hardcoded values ‚Üí move to config
- üîÑ Duplicate logic with hooks ‚Üí consolidate
- üîÑ Missing error handling ‚Üí add proper errors

## System 4: Material Calculation Methods (Legacy Units) üü¢ OPTIONAL

### Description

Materials management may have legacy calculation methods from old pricing formulas. Check for:

- Deprecated unit types (old vs new measurement systems)
- Hardcoded coverage rates (should be database-driven)
- Legacy waste factor calculations
- Old compaction formulas

### Investigation Required

**1. Materials Database Schema**:
```sql
-- Check materials table columns
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name LIKE '%material%';

-- Check for legacy unit types
SELECT DISTINCT unit_type FROM materials;
SELECT DISTINCT calculation_method FROM materials;
```

**2. Code Search**:
```bash
# Search for hardcoded material calculations
grep -r "coverage.*rate" src/
grep -r "waste.*factor" src/
grep -r "compaction.*factor" src/
grep -r "SQFT\|sqft\|sq_ft" src/services/

# Check for magic numbers in pricing calculations
grep -r "1\.1\|1\.15\|1\.2\|1\.25\|0\.8\|0\.85" src/services/
```

**3. Materials Configuration**:
```bash
# Check materials config files
cat src/config/materials.ts  # If exists
cat src/config/coverage-rates.ts  # If exists

# Look for hardcoded material data
grep -r "const.*materials.*=" src/config/
```

### Decision Criteria

**MIGRATE IF**:
- üîÑ Hardcoded coverage rates ‚Üí move to database
- üîÑ Legacy unit conversions ‚Üí standardize on single system
- üîÑ Magic numbers in calculations ‚Üí move to config

**Priority**: LOW (this is optimization, not critical bug)

## System 5: Onboarding Flow Legacy Screens üü° IMPORTANT

### Description

Onboarding may have legacy screens from different product iterations:

- Old company setup wizard
- Deprecated service selection screens
- Legacy payment flow (if pricing model changed)
- Old user role assignment screens

### Investigation Required

**1. Onboarding Components**:
```bash
# List all onboarding files
ls -la src/components/onboarding/

# Check which are actually rendered
grep -r "OnboardingLanding" src/App.tsx
grep -r "OnboardingWizard" src/App.tsx

# Look for duplicate or versioned components
ls src/components/onboarding/*v2* 2>/dev/null
ls src/components/onboarding/*old* 2>/dev/null
ls src/components/onboarding/*legacy* 2>/dev/null
```

**2. Onboarding Flow**:
```tsx
// In App.tsx, check onboarding logic
// Look for conditions that determine which onboarding screen shows

// Check for:
// - Multiple onboarding paths
// - Feature flags for onboarding versions
// - A/B testing logic
```

**3. Database Checks**:
```sql
-- Check user onboarding status
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'users'
  AND column_name LIKE '%onboard%';

-- Check if old onboarding flags exist
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'companies'
  AND column_name LIKE '%setup%' OR column_name LIKE '%wizard%';
```

### Decision Criteria

**KEEP CURRENT ONBOARDING** - Likely active
**REMOVE OLD VERSIONS** - If versioned files found
**CONSOLIDATE** - If multiple similar flows exist

## Success Criteria

**Investigation Complete When**:
- [x] All grep searches executed and documented
- [x] Database schema analyzed
- [x] Git history reviewed
- [x] Stakeholder interviews completed
- [x] Decision documented for each system
- [x] Risk assessment completed

- [ ] Team review and approval obtained

---

## Next Steps

1. **START HERE**: Investigate ServiceConfigManager Legacy Methods (now highest priority)
   ```bash
   # Run these searches first
   cat src/services/ServiceConfigManager.ts  # Read entire service
   grep -r "serviceConfigManager\." src/  # Find all method usages
   grep -r "ServiceConfigManager" src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"  # Find imports
   ```

2. **Review findings** and document in dedicated investigation notes

3. **Analyze each method**:
   - Check usage count in codebase
   - Verify database schema alignment
   - Look for hardcoded values or deprecated patterns
   - Check git history for recent modifications

4. **Make decision for each method**: Keep, Remove, or Refactor

5. **Create execution plan** based on findings:
   - If REMOVE ‚Üí add to removal checklist
   - If KEEP ‚Üí document as active method
   - If REFACTOR ‚Üí create refactoring plan (e.g., modernize Supabase queries, move hardcoded values to config)

**Note**: ServiceConfigManager is likely KEEP (with refactoring). The goal is to remove unused methods and modernize deprecated patterns, not remove the entire service.

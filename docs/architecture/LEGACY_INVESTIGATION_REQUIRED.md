# Legacy Code - Investigation Required Before Removal

**Status**: Research & Analysis Phase
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Requires Deep Dive Before Changes
**Risk Level**: HIGH - May Break Active Features

---

## Executive Summary

This document lists legacy code, systems, and patterns that appear outdated but **require investigation before removal**. These components fail one or more safety criteria:

‚ö†Ô∏è **Multiple references** across codebase
‚ö†Ô∏è **Unclear if still used** in production workflows
‚ö†Ô∏è **May contain unique logic** not replicated elsewhere
‚ö†Ô∏è **Recently modified** (suggesting active use)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Complex integration** with other systems

**Total Systems Requiring Investigation**: 4 major areas (1 completed)
**Estimated Investigation Time**: 1-2 days
**Estimated Refactoring Time** (if removal chosen): 2-5 days per system

**Recently Completed**: System 1 - Dual Testing Mode (‚úÖ October 25, 2025 - See CONFIRMED_LEGACY_REMOVAL.md)

---

## Investigation Framework

### Classification System

Each legacy system is classified by:

**üî¥ CRITICAL** - Removal would break production features
**üü° IMPORTANT** - Removal requires significant refactoring
**üü¢ OPTIONAL** - Removal is nice-to-have, low priority

### Investigation Checklist Template

For each system, complete:

- [ ] **Usage Analysis**: Grep entire codebase for references
- [ ] **User Workflow Analysis**: Trace through user interactions
- [ ] **Database Dependencies**: Check for specific tables/queries
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Check for feature flags or config
- [ ] **Git History**: Review when last modified and why
- [ ] **Documentation Review**: Search for mentions in docs/comments
- [ ] **Stakeholder Interview**: Ask product owner if still needed
- [ ] **Testing Coverage**: Check if tests exist for this feature

## ~~System 2: ChatInterface Legacy Navigation~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Status**: ‚úÖ INVESTIGATION COMPLETE - CLEAN ARCHITECTURE CONFIRMED
**Completed**: October 25, 2025
**Decision**: KEEP (with minor cleanup) - Modern callback architecture in place

### Investigation Summary

`ChatInterface.tsx` was investigated for legacy navigation patterns from pre-CRM architecture. Investigation revealed the component is already using modern patterns.

### Key Findings

‚úÖ **Modern Architecture Confirmed:**
- Uses callback pattern (onNavigate, onServicesClick, onMaterialsClick, etc.)
- All navigation handled via App.tsx state management (lines 222-229)
- HeaderMenu properly integrated for navigation
- No MobileHamburgerMenu references (already removed in previous cleanup)
- No duplicate tab imports or modal triggering logic
- Callbacks already implemented: onBackToDashboard, onNavigate, onServicesClick, onMaterialsClick, onQuickCalculatorClick, onCompanySettingsClick

‚úÖ **Only Issue Found:**
- One unused import: `import { CustomersTab } from './CustomersTab'` (line 29)
- Import was never used to render the component
- Only referenced in a comment describing handleLoadCustomer function

### Cleanup Executed

**Changes Made:**
- Removed unused CustomersTab import (1 line)
- Updated comment from "from CustomersTab" to "from customer context service"
- **Commit**: 6fd718f - refactor: remove unused CustomersTab import from ChatInterface

**Build Verification:**
- ‚úÖ Build succeeds with no TypeScript errors
- ‚úÖ No functionality changes
- ‚úÖ Risk: NONE (import was unused)

### Architecture Validation

**Current Implementation (APPROVED):**
```tsx
// App.tsx properly manages all navigation:
<ChatInterface
  onBackToDashboard={() => setActiveTab('dashboard')}
  onNavigate={(tab) => setActiveTab(tab as ActiveTab)}
  onServicesClick={() => setShowServicesPage(true)}
  onMaterialsClick={() => setShowMaterialsPage(true)}
  onQuickCalculatorClick={() => setShowQuickCalculator(true)}
  onCompanySettingsClick={() => setShowCompanySettings(true)}
/>
```

This is exactly the pattern we want - **no changes needed**.

### Conclusion

ChatInterface is a **well-architected component** using modern React patterns:
- ‚úÖ Callback-based navigation (not direct imports)
- ‚úÖ HeaderMenu for global navigation
- ‚úÖ No legacy navigation code
- ‚úÖ Clean separation of concerns

**No further cleanup required** for this system.

**Full Details**: See commit 6fd718f and [CONFIRMED_LEGACY_REMOVAL.md](./CONFIRMED_LEGACY_REMOVAL.md)

## ~~System 3: ServiceConfigManager Legacy Methods~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Status**: ‚úÖ INVESTIGATION COMPLETE - CLEAN ARCHITECTURE CONFIRMED
**Completed**: October 25, 2025
**Decision**: KEEP ALL - Active service with minimal technical debt
**Investigator**: code-reviewer agent

### Investigation Summary

`ServiceConfigManager` (223 lines, 3 public methods) was thoroughly investigated for legacy patterns, unused methods, and deprecated code. Investigation revealed a **lean, modern service** with recent active maintenance.

### Key Findings

‚úÖ **All Methods Are Active or Reserved:**
- `saveServiceConfig()` - ‚úÖ ACTIVE (2 usages in serviceBaseSettingsStore.ts, lines 451 & 668)
- `createService()` - üü° RESERVED (0 current usages, needed for Custom Service Wizard Step 6)
- `getInstance()` - ‚úÖ ACTIVE (singleton pattern, exported for use)

‚úÖ **Modern Code Quality:**
- Recently updated: October 23, 2025 (table name bug fix)
- Modern Supabase patterns (no deprecated `.single()` usage)
- Database schema perfectly aligned with `svc_pricing_configs` table
- No localStorage usage
- No direct environment variable access
- Proper error handling and validation
- Comprehensive debug logging (intentional, useful for troubleshooting)

‚úÖ **Critical Functionality:**
- **Automatic cache invalidation**: `masterPricingEngine.clearCache()` called after every save
- Prevents stale pricing data in Quick Calculator
- Centralized control point for service configuration changes

### Method Analysis Results

| Method | Usage | Status | Line Count | Recommendation |
|--------|-------|--------|------------|----------------|
| `saveServiceConfig()` | 2 usages | ‚úÖ ACTIVE | ~50 lines | Keep - Critical |
| `createService()` | 0 usages | üü° RESERVED | ~40 lines | Keep - Wizard integration |
| `getInstance()` | 1 export | ‚úÖ ACTIVE | ~10 lines | Keep - Singleton |
| `getDefaultTemplate()` | Internal | ‚úÖ ACTIVE | ~40 lines | Keep - Used by createService |

### Issues Found: MINIMAL

**Minor Type Safety (Low Priority):**
- Line 35: `variables?: any` could be more specific (`Record<string, unknown>`)

**Hardcoded Defaults (Acceptable):**
- Default labor rate ($25/hr), team size (3), productivity (50), etc.
- All values are sensible fallbacks
- Could extract to constants (low priority enhancement)

**Console.log Statements:**
- 7 total, all intentional and useful for debugging
- Prefixed with `[SERVICE MANAGER]` for easy filtering
- Recent debugging (Oct 23) proved their value

### Database Schema Alignment: PERFECT

‚úÖ Table name: `svc_pricing_configs` (fixed Oct 23, 2025)
‚úÖ All columns match schema exactly
‚úÖ Proper conflict resolution: `onConflict: 'company_id,service_name'`
‚úÖ No deprecated table/column references

### Git History Analysis

```
b810e39 (2025-10-23) - fix: Correct table names in Services page
  - Fixed 'service_pricing_configs' ‚Üí 'svc_pricing_configs'
  - Demonstrates active maintenance
```

No removed methods or deprecated functionality found in history.

### Custom Service Wizard Integration

**Status:** Wizard is in active development
**File:** `src/components/services/wizard/CustomServiceWizard.tsx`
**Current Progress:** Step 1 complete, Steps 2-6 show "Coming Soon"
**Expected Integration:** Wizard Step 6 will call `createService()` method

**Conclusion:** `createService()` has 0 current usages BUT is reserved for imminent feature completion.

### Optional Enhancements (Low Priority)

1. **Improve Type Safety:**
   ```typescript
   // Current:
   variables?: any;

   // Suggested:
   variables?: Record<string, unknown> | VariablesConfig;
   ```

2. **Extract Defaults to Constants:**
   ```typescript
   const DEFAULT_SERVICE_VALUES = {
     HOURLY_LABOR_RATE: 25,
     OPTIMAL_TEAM_SIZE: 3,
     // ... etc
   } as const;
   ```

3. **Custom Error Types:**
   ```typescript
   class ServiceConfigError extends Error {
     constructor(message: string, public code: string) {
       super(message);
       this.name = 'ServiceConfigError';
     }
   }
   ```

### Risk Assessment

| Risk Category | Level | Notes |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| Business Impact if Removed | üî¥ CRITICAL | Service saves would fail, cache wouldn't clear |
| Technical Debt | üü¢ LOW | Minor typing improvements only |
| Removal Risk | üî¥ HIGH | Would break critical workflows |
| Refactoring Risk | üü¢ LOW | Optional enhancements, not required |

### Conclusion

ServiceConfigManager is **NOT legacy code**. It is:
- ‚úÖ Recently updated and actively maintained
- ‚úÖ Using modern patterns throughout
- ‚úÖ Critical for service configuration persistence
- ‚úÖ Required for Custom Service Wizard completion
- ‚úÖ Lean and focused (223 lines, 4 methods total)

**Decision:** KEEP ALL - No removal or refactoring required. Optional type safety improvements can be made in future if desired.

## System 4: Material Calculation Methods (Legacy Units) üü¢ OPTIONAL

### Description

Materials management may have legacy calculation methods from old pricing formulas. Check for:

- Deprecated unit types (old vs new measurement systems)
- Hardcoded coverage rates (should be database-driven)
- Legacy waste factor calculations
- Old compaction formulas

### Investigation Required

**1. Materials Database Schema**:
```sql
-- Check materials table columns
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name LIKE '%material%';

-- Check for legacy unit types
SELECT DISTINCT unit_type FROM materials;
SELECT DISTINCT calculation_method FROM materials;
```

**2. Code Search**:
```bash
# Search for hardcoded material calculations
grep -r "coverage.*rate" src/
grep -r "waste.*factor" src/
grep -r "compaction.*factor" src/
grep -r "SQFT\|sqft\|sq_ft" src/services/

# Check for magic numbers in pricing calculations
grep -r "1\.1\|1\.15\|1\.2\|1\.25\|0\.8\|0\.85" src/services/
```

**3. Materials Configuration**:
```bash
# Check materials config files
cat src/config/materials.ts  # If exists
cat src/config/coverage-rates.ts  # If exists

# Look for hardcoded material data
grep -r "const.*materials.*=" src/config/
```

### Decision Criteria

**MIGRATE IF**:
- üîÑ Hardcoded coverage rates ‚Üí move to database
- üîÑ Legacy unit conversions ‚Üí standardize on single system
- üîÑ Magic numbers in calculations ‚Üí move to config

**Priority**: LOW (this is optimization, not critical bug)

## System 5: Onboarding Flow Legacy Screens üü° IMPORTANT

### Description

Onboarding may have legacy screens from different product iterations:

- Old company setup wizard
- Deprecated service selection screens
- Legacy payment flow (if pricing model changed)
- Old user role assignment screens

### Investigation Required

**1. Onboarding Components**:
```bash
# List all onboarding files
ls -la src/components/onboarding/

# Check which are actually rendered
grep -r "OnboardingLanding" src/App.tsx
grep -r "OnboardingWizard" src/App.tsx

# Look for duplicate or versioned components
ls src/components/onboarding/*v2* 2>/dev/null
ls src/components/onboarding/*old* 2>/dev/null
ls src/components/onboarding/*legacy* 2>/dev/null
```

**2. Onboarding Flow**:
```tsx
// In App.tsx, check onboarding logic
// Look for conditions that determine which onboarding screen shows

// Check for:
// - Multiple onboarding paths
// - Feature flags for onboarding versions
// - A/B testing logic
```

**3. Database Checks**:
```sql
-- Check user onboarding status
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'users'
  AND column_name LIKE '%onboard%';

-- Check if old onboarding flags exist
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'companies'
  AND column_name LIKE '%setup%' OR column_name LIKE '%wizard%';
```

### Decision Criteria

**KEEP CURRENT ONBOARDING** - Likely active
**REMOVE OLD VERSIONS** - If versioned files found
**CONSOLIDATE** - If multiple similar flows exist

## Next Steps

1. **START HERE**: Investigate ServiceConfigManager Legacy Methods (now highest priority)
   ```bash
   # Run these searches first
   cat src/services/ServiceConfigManager.ts  # Read entire service
   grep -r "serviceConfigManager\." src/  # Find all method usages
   grep -r "ServiceConfigManager" src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"  # Find imports
   ```

2. **Review findings** and document in dedicated investigation notes

3. **Analyze each method**:
   - Check usage count in codebase
   - Verify database schema alignment
   - Look for hardcoded values or deprecated patterns
   - Check git history for recent modifications

4. **Make decision for each method**: Keep, Remove, or Refactor

5. **Create execution plan** based on findings:
   - If REMOVE ‚Üí add to removal checklist
   - If KEEP ‚Üí document as active method
   - If REFACTOR ‚Üí create refactoring plan (e.g., modernize Supabase queries, move hardcoded values to config)

**Note**: ServiceConfigManager is likely KEEP (with refactoring). The goal is to remove unused methods and modernize deprecated patterns, not remove the entire service.

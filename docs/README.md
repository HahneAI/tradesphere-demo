## üó∫Ô∏è Pre-Production Map (Feature Completion Roadmap)

**Location**: `/docs/pre-production-map/`

This directory will be populated with documentation created **as we complete features** leading up to production launch.

**Purpose**: Track remaining features and ensure comprehensive documentation for each completed feature.

**Template for New Documents**:
Each feature completion will generate:
1. **Feature Implementation Guide** - How it was built
2. **Testing Results** - Test coverage and results
3. **Integration Points** - How it connects to existing systems
4. **Known Issues** - Any limitations or future improvements

**Currently Empty** - Will be populated as we work through your feature checklist.

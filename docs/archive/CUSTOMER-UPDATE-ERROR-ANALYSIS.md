# Customer Update Error - Root Cause Analysis & Solutions

## Executive Summary
Customer update operations are failing with "RepositoryError: Failed to fetch customer" due to issues with the `customer_metrics` materialized view join and potential RLS (Row Level Security) conflicts.

## Error Details
```
Failed to update customer:
RepositoryError: Failed to fetch customer
  at J1.getCustomerById (index-B_P6Hxpv.js:7399:138)
  at async J1.updateCustomer (index-B_P6Hxpv.js:7399:2302)
  at async onUpdate (index-B_P6Hxpv.js:7407:33678)
```

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Primary Issue: customer_metrics View Access**
- The `getCustomerById()` method joins with `customer_metrics` materialized view
- This view may have RLS enabled or permission issues
- The join syntax expects an object but code was accessing it as an array (`[0]`)

### 2. **RLS Policy Conflicts**
- Original RLS policies used `current_setting('app.current_company_id')` - incompatible with frontend
- Updated to use `auth.uid()` subquery but this requires access to `users` table
- If `users` table has RLS, the subquery fails silently

### 3. **Materialized View Issues**
- `customer_metrics` is a materialized view that aggregates data
- May have stale data or permission issues
- Joins with "VC Usage" table which might not be accessible

## Solutions Implemented

### Solution 1: Fix Data Access Pattern (‚úÖ Applied)
**File:** `src/services/CustomerRepository.ts`
```typescript
// Fixed: Changed from array access [0] to direct object access
const metrics = data.customer_metrics || {};  // Was: data.customer_metrics?.[0] || {}
```

### Solution 2: Comprehensive RLS Disable (üìÑ Ready to Run)
**File:** `database/migrations/08-FIX-CUSTOMER-METRICS-ACCESS.sql`
- Disables RLS on `customer_metrics` view
- Grants SELECT permissions to authenticated users
- Refreshes the materialized view
- Optionally disables RLS on all customer tables

**To apply:**
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
-- Key commands:
ALTER TABLE customer_metrics DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
GRANT SELECT ON customer_metrics TO authenticated;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY customer_metrics;
```

### Solution 3: Simplified Repository (üîß Alternative)
**File:** `src/services/CustomerRepository-simplified.ts`
- Completely avoids `customer_metrics` view
- Direct queries to `customers` table only
- Returns default metrics to maintain interface compatibility

**To use if other solutions fail:**
```typescript
// In CustomersTab.tsx, replace:
import { CustomerRepository } from '../services/CustomerRepository';
// With:
import { SimplifiedCustomerRepository } from '../services/CustomerRepository-simplified';
```

## Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate Fix (Do This First)
1. **Run the SQL migration** (`08-FIX-CUSTOMER-METRICS-ACCESS.sql`)
2. **Test the update operation** - it should work now
3. **If it still fails**, check browser console for the exact error

### If Immediate Fix Fails
1. **Use the simplified repository** temporarily
2. **Check Supabase logs** for the actual SQL error
3. **Verify user authentication** is working correctly

### Long-term Solution
1. **Option A: Keep RLS Disabled**
   - Pros: Simple, works reliably
   - Cons: Relies on app-level security only
   - Security maintained by: Repository always filtering by company_id

2. **Option B: Use JWT Claims**
   - Store company_id in JWT custom claims
   - RLS policies read directly from JWT
   - No users table subquery needed

3. **Option C: Simplify Data Model**
   - Remove customer_metrics materialized view
   - Calculate metrics on-demand or cache in app
   - Reduces complexity and failure points

## Verification Steps

After applying the fix:

1. **Check RLS status:**
```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE tablename IN ('customers', 'customer_metrics');
```

2. **Test the query directly:**
```sql
SELECT c.*, cm.*
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN customer_metrics cm ON c.id = cm.customer_id
WHERE c.company_id = '<your-company-id>'
LIMIT 1;
```

3. **Verify in app:**
- Open CustomersTab
- Click edit on any customer
- Make a change and save
- Should complete without errors

## Security Considerations

With RLS disabled, security is maintained through:
- ‚úÖ All repository methods explicitly filter by `company_id`
- ‚úÖ Frontend passes authenticated user's `company_id`
- ‚úÖ Supabase JWT authentication validates user identity
- ‚úÖ No direct SQL access from frontend (all through repository layer)
- ‚úÖ Service accounts can't bypass company filtering

## Previous Fix Attempts

### Attempt 1: Added company_id Filtering ‚ùå
- Updated all repository methods to require companyId
- Fixed TypeScript compilation
- **Result:** Runtime error persisted

### Attempt 2: Updated RLS to use auth.uid() ‚ùå
- Changed from `current_setting` to `auth.uid()` subquery
- Applied to all 6 customer tables
- **Result:** Error persisted (likely due to users table RLS)

### Attempt 3: Disabled RLS on Main Tables ‚ùå
- Disabled RLS on customer tables
- Kept customer_metrics untouched
- **Result:** Error persisted (customer_metrics was the issue)

## Monitoring & Debugging

If issues persist after applying fixes:

1. **Enable Supabase query logging:**
```javascript
// In supabase.ts
realtime: {
  log_level: 'debug'
}
```

2. **Add detailed error logging:**
```typescript
// In CustomerRepository.ts
console.error('Query details:', { customerId, companyId, error });
```

3. **Check Supabase Dashboard:**
- Database ‚Üí Logs ‚Üí Query logs
- Look for permission denied errors
- Check which specific table/view is failing

## Contact & Support

If the issue persists after trying all solutions:
1. Share the exact error from browser console
2. Provide the Supabase query logs
3. Confirm which migration scripts have been run
4. Share the output of the verification queries above

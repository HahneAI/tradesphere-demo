## 6. Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

### Status: ENABLED
All ops_ tables have RLS enabled and properly configured.

### ops_jobs RLS Policies
```
1. "Users can view jobs from their company"
   - Type: PERMISSIVE SELECT
   - Condition: company_id IN (user's company)
   - Roles: public

2. "Users can insert jobs for their company"
   - Type: PERMISSIVE INSERT
   - Condition: company_id IN (user's company)
   - Roles: public

3. "Users can update jobs from their company"
   - Type: PERMISSIVE UPDATE
   - Condition: company_id IN (user's company)
   - Roles: public

4. "Users can delete jobs from their company"
   - Type: PERMISSIVE DELETE
   - Condition: company_id IN (user's company)
   - Roles: public
```

### ops_job_services RLS Policies
```
1. "Users can view job services for their company jobs"
2. "Users can insert job services for their company jobs"
3. "Users can update job services for their company jobs"
4. "Users can delete job services for their company jobs"

All policies check:
- job_id IN (SELECT ops_jobs.id WHERE ops_jobs.company_id IN (user's company))
```

### ops_job_notes RLS Policies
```
1. "Users can view job notes for their company jobs"
2. "Users can insert job notes for their company jobs"
3. "Users can update job notes for their company jobs"
4. "Users can delete job notes for their company jobs"

All policies check:
- job_id IN (SELECT ops_jobs.id WHERE ops_jobs.company_id IN (user's company))
```

### ops_job_assignments RLS Policies
```
All 4 CRUD policies configured with same company-based access control
```

### RLS Impact on Frontend Data Access

**Key Point:** RLS policies require authenticated user context (auth.uid()) to function properly.

**Access Control Flow:**
1. User authenticates via Supabase Auth
2. auth.uid() returns the authenticated user's ID
3. RLS policies check: SELECT ops_jobs WHERE company_id IN (SELECT company_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid())
4. Only jobs belonging to user's company are returned

**Frontend Considerations:**
- All queries must be made through authenticated Supabase client
- Ensure Supabase session is initialized before loading jobs
- Client must be configured with proper API key and project URL
- RLS will automatically filter results based on current user

## 7. Company and Customer Relationships

### Company Verification
```
Company ID: 08f0827a-608f-485a-a19f-e0c55ecf6484
Status: EXISTS in companies table
Jobs using this company: 4
```

### Customer Verification
All 3 unique customers exist in crm_customers table:

```
1. Customer: 208a273a-bc07-41df-bc46-497e2eca2af0
   Company: 08f0827a-608f-485a-a19f-e0c55ecf6484
   Jobs: 2 (JOB-2025-001, JOB-2025-002)

2. Customer: 5d4c0f52-a321-427a-9130-52b28bcf2c7f
   Company: 08f0827a-608f-485a-a19f-e0c55ecf6484
   Jobs: 1 (JOB-2025-003)

3. Customer: 235fc55a-adce-4569-99f2-521abaa655b3
   Company: 08f0827a-608f-485a-a19f-e0c55ecf6484
   Jobs: 1 (JOB-2025-004)
```

## 8. Potential Access Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: RLS Policies Blocking Data Access
**Symptom:** Frontend returns empty jobs list or "permission denied" errors

**Cause:** Unauthenticated requests or user belongs to different company

**Solution:**
1. Verify Supabase authentication is initialized
2. Check that logged-in user belongs to company: 08f0827a-608f-485a-a19f-e0c55ecf6484
3. Confirm client uses authenticated Supabase instance
4. Check browser console for RLS error messages

### Issue 2: Missing Company Assignment
**Symptom:** User can see some jobs but not others

**Cause:** User's company_id in users table doesn't match job company_id

**Solution:**
1. Verify user record has correct company_id in users table
2. Jobs table company_id: 08f0827a-608f-485a-a19f-e0c55ecf6484
3. Update user record if needed: UPDATE users SET company_id = '08f0827a-608f-485a-a19f-e0c55ecf6484' WHERE id = {user_id}

### Issue 3: Cascading RLS on Related Tables
**Symptom:** Can view jobs but not services or notes

**Cause:** RLS on ops_job_services and ops_job_notes depend on ops_jobs RLS

**Solution:**
- This is by design - if user can't see job, they can't see services/notes
- Verify primary job query succeeds first
- Check all parent job relationships are valid

---

## 9. Performance Considerations

### Current Data Volume
- 4 jobs with minimal data (good for testing)
- 8 services (2 per job)
- 8 notes (2 per job)
- 0 assignments/crews (scalable for future growth)

### Recommendations for Frontend Optimization

#### 1. Query Optimization
```sql
-- Recommended query structure for listing jobs with related data:
SELECT
  j.*,
  COUNT(DISTINCT js.id) as service_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT jn.id) as note_count
FROM ops_jobs j
LEFT JOIN ops_job_services js ON j.id = js.job_id
LEFT JOIN ops_job_notes jn ON j.id = jn.job_id
WHERE j.company_id = {company_id}
GROUP BY j.id
ORDER BY j.created_at DESC;
```

#### 2. Indexes Present
- Primary key indexes on all tables
- Foreign key indexes (implicit)
- RLS policy evaluation is optimized with indexed company_id

#### 3. Recommended Frontend Caching Strategy
- Cache job list for 5-10 minutes
- Invalidate cache on job create/update/delete
- Load full job details on demand (not in list view)

## 11. Quick Reference for Developers

### Connection String Details
```
Database: PostgreSQL (Supabase)
Company ID: 08f0827a-608f-485a-a19f-e0c55ecf6484
Tables: ops_jobs, ops_job_services, ops_job_notes, ops_job_assignments, ops_crews, ops_crew_members
RLS: ENABLED (all tables)
```

### Sample Query (with RLS)
```javascript
// JavaScript/Supabase client
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('ops_jobs')
  .select(`
    *,
    ops_job_services(*),
    ops_job_notes(*)
  `)
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false });
```

### Key Takeaways
1. Database structure is complete and verified
2. Test data is comprehensive and properly related
3. RLS policies are correctly configured for multi-tenancy
4. All foreign key relationships are intact
5. Frontend can safely load jobs with proper authentication
6. No data access issues detected

## 12. Action Items for Frontend Integration

- [ ] Ensure Supabase client is initialized with auth
- [ ] Verify user authentication before loading jobs
- [ ] Test job list loading with authenticated user
- [ ] Test job services loading
- [ ] Test job notes loading
- [ ] Verify RLS filtering works (user only sees jobs from their company)
- [ ] Set up error handling for RLS permission errors
- [ ] Implement caching strategy for job lists
- [ ] Add loading states during data fetch
- [ ] Test pagination for future data growth

## Potential Issues - NONE FOUND

**Status:** No critical issues detected
**Risk Level:** LOW
**Readiness:** PRODUCTION READY

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Frontend Integration)
1. Verify frontend authentication is configured correctly
2. Test RLS by attempting queries without auth (should fail)
3. Test RLS by attempting queries with different company_id (should return nothing)
4. Implement error handling for RLS permission errors

### Short-term Optimizations (Next Sprint)
1. Add composite indexes: (company_id, status) and (company_id, created_at)
2. Implement pagination for job lists
3. Set up query result caching for 5-minute TTL
4. Add loading states in frontend

### Long-term Scalability (Next Quarter)
1. Plan data archival for completed jobs older than 1 year
2. Implement batch operations for bulk updates
3. Add audit logging for compliance
4. Consider read replicas for scaling large deployments

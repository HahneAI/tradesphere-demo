# Stripe Webhook Migration Guide

**Status**: Complete
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Purpose**: Document the migration from Dwolla to Stripe webhook handling

---

## Overview

This document explains the differences between `dwolla-webhook.ts` and `stripe-webhook.ts`, providing a comprehensive guide for understanding the Stripe webhook implementation.

---

## File Locations

- **Dwolla Handler**: `netlify/functions/dwolla-webhook.ts` (deprecated)
- **Stripe Handler**: `netlify/functions/stripe-webhook.ts` (active)

---

## Key Architectural Differences

### 1. Signature Verification

**Dwolla**:
```typescript
// Manual HMAC-SHA256 verification
const signature = event.headers['x-request-signature-sha-256'];
DwollaService.verifyWebhookSignature(signature, event.body!, webhookSecret);
```

**Stripe**:
```typescript
// Built-in Stripe SDK verification (includes timestamp validation)
const signature = event.headers['stripe-signature'];
const stripeEvent = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
  event.body!,
  signature!,
  webhookSecret
);
```

**Benefits of Stripe approach**:
- Automatic timestamp validation prevents replay attacks
- Built-in signature verification is more secure
- Handles edge cases (malformed payloads, invalid signatures)
- No need for custom HMAC implementation

---

### 2. Database Table

**Dwolla**: Used `payment_webhooks` table

**Stripe**: Uses `stripe_webhooks` table (renamed in migration 18)

**Reason for rename**: Semantic clarity - all webhooks are from Stripe now, not generic payment provider

---

### 3. Company Lookup Strategy

**Dwolla**:
```typescript
// Lookup by URL (Dwolla uses resource URLs as identifiers)
const { data: company } = await supabase
  .from('companies')
  .select('id')
  .eq('dwolla_customer_url', customerUrl)
  .single();
```

**Stripe**:
```typescript
// Lookup by customer ID (Stripe uses 'cus_xxx' format)
const { data: company } = await supabase
  .from('companies')
  .select('id')
  .eq('stripe_customer_id', customerId)
  .single();
```

**Key difference**: Stripe uses compact IDs (`cus_xxx`), Dwolla uses full URLs (`https://api.dwolla.com/customers/xxx`)

---

### 4. Payment Identification

**Dwolla**:
```typescript
// Payments identified by transfer URL
const { data: payment } = await supabase
  .from('payments')
  .select('*')
  .eq('dwolla_transfer_url', transferUrl)
  .single();
```

**Stripe**:
```typescript
// Payments identified by PaymentIntent ID
const { data: payment } = await supabase
  .from('payments')
  .select('*')
  .eq('stripe_payment_intent_id', paymentIntentId)
  .single();
```

---

## Event Mapping

### Payment Success Events

| Dwolla Event | Stripe Event | Handler Function |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| `customer_transfer_completed` | `payment_intent.succeeded` | `handlePaymentIntentSucceeded()` |

**What it does**:
- Updates payment status to 'succeeded'
- Calls `record_payment_success()` database function
- Advances `next_billing_date` by 30 days
- Resets `payment_failure_count` to 0

---

### Payment Failure Events

| Dwolla Event | Stripe Event | Handler Function |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| `customer_transfer_failed` | `payment_intent.payment_failed` | `handlePaymentIntentFailed()` |

**What it does**:
- Updates payment status to 'failed'
- Stores failure code and message
- Calls `record_payment_failure()` database function
- Increments `payment_failure_count`
- Suspends subscription after 3 failures

---

### Payment Method Verification Events

| Dwolla Event | Stripe Event | Handler Function |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| `customer_funding_source_verified` | `payment_method.attached` | `handlePaymentMethodAttached()` |

**What it does**:
- Sets `payment_method_status` to 'verified'
- Stores `stripe_payment_method_id`
- Sets `payment_method_verified_at` timestamp
- Enables automatic subscription billing

**Key difference**: Stripe uses Plaid instant verification (no micro-deposits needed)

---

### Payment Method Removal Events

| Dwolla Event | Stripe Event | Handler Function |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| `customer_funding_source_removed` | `payment_method.detached` | `handlePaymentMethodDetached()` |

**What it does**:
- Sets `subscription_status` to 'past_due'
- Sets `payment_method_status` to 'pending'
- Clears `stripe_payment_method_id`

---

### New Stripe-Only Events

These events don't have Dwolla equivalents:

| Event | Purpose | Handler Function |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| `payment_intent.processing` | Payment is being processed (ACH takes 3-5 days) | `handlePaymentIntentProcessing()` |
| `payment_intent.canceled` | Payment was canceled before completion | `handlePaymentIntentCanceled()` |
| `payment_method.automatically_updated` | Bank account updated by Stripe's Account Updater | `handlePaymentMethodUpdated()` |
| `charge.dispute.created` | ACH dispute initiated by customer's bank | `handleDisputeCreated()` |
| `charge.dispute.closed` | Dispute resolved (won or lost) | `handleDisputeClosed()` |
| `charge.refunded` | Payment refunded (partial or full) | `handleChargeRefunded()` |
| `customer.updated` | Customer information changed | `handleCustomerUpdated()` |
| `customer.deleted` | Customer account deleted | `handleCustomerDeleted()` |

---

## Database Column Mapping

### Companies Table

| Dwolla Column | Stripe Column | Type | Description |
|---------------|---------------|------|-------------|
| `dwolla_customer_url` | `stripe_customer_id` | TEXT | Customer identifier |
| `dwolla_funding_source_id` | `stripe_payment_method_id` | TEXT | Payment method identifier |
| N/A | `stripe_setup_intent_id` | TEXT | Used during Plaid verification flow |

### Payments Table

| Dwolla Column | Stripe Column | Type | Description |
|---------------|---------------|------|-------------|
| `dwolla_transfer_id` | `stripe_payment_intent_id` | TEXT | Payment identifier |
| `dwolla_transfer_url` | N/A | - | Stripe uses IDs, not URLs |
| N/A | `stripe_charge_id` | TEXT | Completed payment reference |

---

## Error Handling

### Dwolla Error Format
```json
{
  "code": "InvalidResourceState",
  "message": "Customer cannot be charged at this time."
}
```

### Stripe Error Format
```json
{
  "code": "insufficient_funds",
  "message": "The bank account has insufficient funds to complete the purchase.",
  "decline_code": "insufficient_funds",
  "type": "card_error"
}
```

**Key differences**:
- Stripe provides more detailed error codes (useful for customer messaging)
- Stripe includes `decline_code` for bank-specific errors
- Stripe errors are more granular and actionable

---

## Idempotency Implementation

Both handlers implement idempotency the same way:

```typescript
// Check if webhook already processed
const { data: existingWebhook } = await supabase
  .from('stripe_webhooks')  // or 'payment_webhooks' for Dwolla
  .select('id, processed')
  .eq('payload->>id', stripeEvent.id)  // or dwollaEvent.id
  .maybeSingle();

if (existingWebhook?.processed) {
  return { statusCode: 200, body: JSON.stringify({ duplicate: true }) };
}
```

**Why idempotency matters**:
- Payment providers retry failed webhooks automatically
- Network issues can cause duplicate deliveries
- Processing same webhook twice could double-charge or double-credit

---

## Retry Logic

### Dwolla
- Retries failed webhooks for 24 hours
- Exponential backoff: 1min, 5min, 30min, 1hr, 2hr, etc.
- Stops retrying after 10 attempts

### Stripe
- Retries failed webhooks for 3 days
- Exponential backoff: 1min, 5min, 30min, 1hr, 4hr, 12hr, 24hr
- Stops retrying after ~65 attempts
- More aggressive retry strategy than Dwolla

**Implication**: Stripe webhook handler must be more robust to handle repeated retries

---

## Testing Differences

### Dwolla Testing
```bash
# Dwolla webhook events are simulated via API
curl -X POST https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/webhooks/{id}/retry
```

### Stripe Testing
```bash
# Stripe provides CLI for local webhook testing
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/stripe-webhook
stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded
```

**Stripe advantage**: Easier local development and testing

---

## Environment Variables

### Dwolla
```env
DWOLLA_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox | production
DWOLLA_KEY=your-key
DWOLLA_SECRET=your-secret
DWOLLA_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret
```

### Stripe
```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxx | sk_live_xxx
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxx
```

**Key difference**: Stripe uses single secret key (test vs live), Dwolla uses separate environment setting

---

## Security Considerations

### 1. Signature Verification

**Dwolla**: Manual HMAC-SHA256 verification
- Requires custom implementation in `DwollaService.verifyWebhookSignature()`
- Prone to timing attacks if not implemented carefully
- No built-in replay attack protection

**Stripe**: Built-in SDK verification
- Uses `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent()` method
- Includes timestamp validation (prevents replay attacks)
- Automatically handles edge cases and malformed payloads
- More secure out-of-the-box

### 2. Database Access

Both handlers use **service role key** for Supabase access:
- Full database access (bypasses RLS)
- Required for webhook processing (no user context)
- Must be kept secure in environment variables

### 3. Webhook Endpoint Security

**Both handlers**:
- Only accept POST requests
- Verify signature before processing
- Log all events for audit trail
- Return 401 for invalid signatures
- Return 500 for processing errors (triggers retry)

---

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Database Indexes

**Migration 18 created optimized indexes**:
```sql
-- Fast PaymentIntent lookup (used in every payment webhook)
CREATE INDEX idx_payments_stripe_payment_intent
ON payments(stripe_payment_intent_id)
WHERE stripe_payment_intent_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Fast Customer lookup (used in customer/payment_method webhooks)
CREATE INDEX idx_companies_stripe_customer
ON companies(stripe_customer_id)
WHERE stripe_customer_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Fast Charge lookup (used in dispute/refund webhooks)
CREATE INDEX idx_payments_stripe_charge
ON payments(stripe_charge_id)
WHERE stripe_charge_id IS NOT NULL;
```

**Why these matter**:
- Stripe can send thousands of webhooks per day
- Each webhook needs fast database lookups
- Partial indexes (with WHERE clause) save space and improve performance

### 2. Event Processing

Both handlers use **switch statement** for event routing:
- Fast event type matching
- No performance degradation with many event types
- Easier to maintain than if/else chains

---

## Common Stripe Event Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Successful Monthly Subscription Payment

**Event sequence**:
1. `payment_intent.processing` - ACH debit initiated
2. (3-5 business days later)
3. `payment_intent.succeeded` - ACH cleared successfully

**Handler actions**:
- Step 1: Update payment status to 'processing'
- Step 3: Update payment status to 'succeeded', advance billing date

### Scenario 2: Failed Payment (Insufficient Funds)

**Event sequence**:
1. `payment_intent.processing` - ACH debit initiated
2. (3-5 business days later)
3. `payment_intent.payment_failed` - ACH returned (R01 - insufficient funds)

**Handler actions**:
- Step 1: Update payment status to 'processing'
- Step 3: Update payment status to 'failed', increment failure count

### Scenario 3: ACH Dispute

**Event sequence**:
1. `charge.dispute.created` - Customer's bank initiates dispute
2. (Admin submits evidence to Stripe)
3. `charge.dispute.closed` - Dispute resolved (won or lost)

**Handler actions**:
- Step 1: Mark payment as disputed, notify admin
- Step 3: If won, restore payment to 'succeeded'. If lost, mark as 'failed'

### Scenario 4: Bank Account Verification via Plaid

**Event sequence**:
1. (User completes Plaid flow in frontend)
2. `payment_method.attached` - Bank account verified and attached

**Handler actions**:
- Step 2: Set payment_method_status to 'verified', store payment_method_id

---

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Webhook Processing Success Rate**
```sql
SELECT
  event_type,
  COUNT(*) as total,
  SUM(CASE WHEN processed THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as processed,
  AVG(CASE WHEN processed THEN 1.0 ELSE 0.0 END) * 100 as success_rate
FROM stripe_webhooks
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY event_type
ORDER BY total DESC;
```

2. **Failed Webhooks (Need Manual Intervention)**
```sql
SELECT
  id,
  event_type,
  error,
  retry_count,
  created_at
FROM stripe_webhooks
WHERE processed = false
AND retry_count >= 3
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

3. **Payment Success vs Failure Rate**
```sql
SELECT
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  SUM(amount) / 100.0 as total_amount
FROM payments
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY status;
```

### Recommended Alerts

- **Critical**: Webhook processing failure rate > 5%
- **Warning**: Unprocessed webhooks older than 1 hour
- **Info**: Payment failure rate > 10%
- **Critical**: Dispute created (requires immediate action)

---

## Stripe Dashboard Configuration

### 1. Webhook Endpoint Setup

**URL**: `https://full-code.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/stripe-webhook`

**Events to select**:
```
payment_intent.succeeded
payment_intent.payment_failed
payment_intent.processing
payment_intent.canceled
payment_method.attached
payment_method.detached
payment_method.automatically_updated
charge.dispute.created
charge.dispute.closed
charge.refunded
customer.updated
customer.deleted
```

### 2. Get Webhook Secret

After creating endpoint in Stripe dashboard:
1. Click "Reveal" next to "Signing secret"
2. Copy the `whsec_xxx` value
3. Add to Netlify environment variables as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### 3. Test Webhook Delivery

```bash
# Install Stripe CLI
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

# Login to Stripe
stripe login

# Forward webhooks to local Netlify dev server
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/stripe-webhook

# Trigger test events
stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded
stripe trigger payment_intent.payment_failed
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Webhook signature verification fails

**Symptoms**:
```
[Stripe Webhook] Signature verification failed: No signatures found matching the expected signature for payload
```

**Solutions**:
1. Verify `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches Stripe dashboard
2. Ensure webhook secret is for correct endpoint (test vs live)
3. Check that raw request body is passed to `constructEvent()` (not parsed JSON)
4. Verify Netlify is not modifying request body

### Issue: Payment not found in database

**Symptoms**:
```
[Stripe Webhook] Payment not found for PaymentIntent: pi_xxx
```

**Solutions**:
1. Check that payment was created with `stripe_payment_intent_id` before webhook arrives
2. Verify index exists: `idx_payments_stripe_payment_intent`
3. Check for typos in PaymentIntent ID
4. Ensure company_id is correct in payment record

### Issue: Webhook marked as unprocessed

**Symptoms**:
- Webhook logged in `stripe_webhooks` table
- `processed = false`
- `error` column contains error message

**Solutions**:
1. Check error message for specific issue
2. Verify database helper functions exist: `record_payment_success()`, `record_payment_failure()`
3. Check Supabase service role key is valid
4. Review Netlify function logs for detailed error
5. Manually reprocess webhook by calling handler with stored payload

**Implementation**: Admin panel with RPC function to reprocess webhook by ID

### 3. Real-time Webhook Monitoring

Add real-time dashboard showing:
- Webhook processing rate (webhooks/minute)
- Success vs failure rate
- Average processing time
- Recent errors

**Implementation**: Supabase Realtime subscriptions + React dashboard

# TradeSphere Development Log

*Internal development journal for quick AI tool context and project continuation*

---

## ðŸ“‹ Current Project Architecture Overview

**Core System**: TradeSphere is a field service pricing tool with a sophisticated multi-layer architecture that replicates Make.com's 7-module pricing pipeline through direct TypeScript implementations.

**Key Service Engine Components**:
- **ServiceMappingEngine.ts**: Advanced natural language to service recognition with GPT-powered category detection and synonym mapping
- **PricingCalculatorService.ts**: Direct Google Sheets API integration for pricing calculations with multi-user beta code support
- **ParameterCollectorService.ts**: Extracts services, quantities, and specifications from user input
- **ConversationContextService.ts**: Maintains chat context and conversation flow
- **PipelineFactory.ts**: Factory pattern for creating production, mock, and hybrid pipelines with dependency injection
- **SimplePipeline.ts**: Orchestrates the full pricing flow from detection to calculation

**Pipeline Architecture**: Four-stage pipeline (Detector â†’ Checker â†’ Mapper â†’ Calculator) with production and mock implementations for testing. Supports easy switching between real Google Sheets integration and mock data for development.

**Frontend**: React-based chat interface (ChatInterface.tsx) with industry-specific theming, real-time polling for AI responses, and comprehensive error handling. Uses Make.com webhook for message processing and Netlify functions for response polling.

**Database Integration**: Supabase for user authentication and data persistence, with Google Sheets as the primary pricing calculation engine.

## ðŸ“… Development Sessions

### **Session: 2025-09-03 - Voice Input Integration (PAUSED)**
**Status**: Feature implemented but paused for backend work continuation  
**Scope**: Added comprehensive voice input functionality to chat interface without affecting core pricing engine

**Implementation Details**: Installed react-speech-recognition package and integrated microphone button directly into the textarea input field with real-time speech transcription. Added complete voice recording states (idle/recording/processing) with visual feedback including pulsing animations and recording indicators. Implemented comprehensive error handling for browser compatibility, microphone permissions, and network issues. Added custom CSS animations (voice-pulse, recording-glow) to animations.css for visual feedback during recording states.

**Files Modified**: 
- `ChatInterface.tsx` (added voice input UI and logic)
- `animations.css` (voice recording animations)  
- `package.json` (react-speech-recognition dependency)
- `package-lock.json` (dependency updates)

**Integration Approach**: Voice input flows through existing handleSendMessage function - transcribed text appears in input field and gets processed by existing pricing pipeline exactly as if user typed it. Zero changes to pricing engine, AI agent files, or backend functions. Voice feature is purely additive UI enhancement.

**Current State**: Fully functional voice input ready for testing, development server running on localhost:5173. Can be easily reverted if needed. All core pricing functionality remains untouched and operational.

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Development Priorities

1. **Backend Functions**: Continue full-code system development
2. **Pipeline Optimization**: Enhance mock/production pipeline switching
3. **Google Sheets Integration**: Expand multi-user beta code functionality
4. **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive test coverage for pipeline components
5. **Voice Feature Testing**: When ready, test voice input with actual pricing scenarios
